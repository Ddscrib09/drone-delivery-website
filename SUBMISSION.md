# Submission: Drone Delivery Website

Public site URL:

 - https://Ddscrib09.github.io/drone-delivery-website/

What this contains:

 - `docs/` — The static site published to GitHub Pages (copied from `public/`).
 - `docs/index.html` — Main landing page.
 - `docs/drones.html` — Drone gallery page.
 - `docs/images/` — Images used on the site.

How to view (two options):

1. Online (recommended): open the URL above — it is served via GitHub Pages from the `docs/` folder on the `main` branch.
2. Locally: run this from the project root and open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser:

```bash
cd /workspaces/drone-delivery-website
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory docs
```

Notes:

 - Images were added from user-provided links and Unsplash placeholders; ensure you have the right to redistribute any images if you re-publish elsewhere.
 - If the Pages site shows a 404, wait a minute for GitHub to deploy, or check Settings → Pages to confirm Source is `main` / `/docs`.
